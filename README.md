<h2> Acknowledgements </h2>
This is my own version of Abhay Talreja's 'Love-to-Eat' app made from his wonderful 'React JS - Build Real World Applications' course on Udemy. In particular, this version incorporates the Mern-stack as opposed to local-storage and allows users to edit and update their recipes.
This guide was particularly helpful in the creation of this app https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/using-create-react-app-with-a-server/
